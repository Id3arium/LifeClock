# Life Clock

## You can't know for certain when you will die. 

### But I can show you for how long you've lived. 

How many seconds, how many minutes, how many hours, how many days, how many weeks, how many months, how many years have passed since you were born? 

Think of everything you've experienced in this time. 

Did things go the way you expected?

What will you do next?
